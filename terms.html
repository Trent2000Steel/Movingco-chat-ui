  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

  <p>Last updated: May 2025</p>

  <p>Welcome to MovingCo. We provide move coordination services for long-distance relocations through our proprietary MoveSafe Method™. By using our website and services, you agree to the following terms.</p>

  <h2>1. Services Provided</h2>
  <p>MovingCo is not a carrier, broker, or moving company. We act as a coordination service, connecting you with licensed third-party movers and freight carriers. We do not transport goods ourselves.</p>

  <h2>2. Quotes and Pricing</h2>
  <p>All quotes provided through the chat interface are estimates based on the information you provide. Final pricing is confirmed after your concierge call and item inventory review. We reserve the right to adjust pricing based on scope, inventory, access conditions, or timing.</p>

  <h2>3. Deposits and Cancellations</h2>
  <p>When you reserve a move with an $85 deposit, that amount is fully refundable if we are unable to coordinate your move, or if you choose not to proceed after your concierge call. Once coordination is confirmed and work begins, deposits become non-refundable.</p>

  <h2>4. No Liability for Loss or Damage</h2>
  <p>Because MovingCo does not physically handle or transport your items, we are not liable for loss, damage, or delays. You may optionally purchase <strong>Premium Move Coverage™</strong> for reimbursement of eligible declared items. This coverage is limited and subject to terms provided during booking.</p>

  <h2>5. User Conduct</h2>
  <p>You agree to provide accurate information about your move and to communicate respectfully with our team and partners. Abuse or misuse of the platform may result in service denial.</p>

  <h2>6. Disclaimers</h2>
  <p>All information provided through this site is for general guidance only and is subject to change. We do not guarantee availability, timelines, or specific outcomes.</p>

  <h2>7. Changes to Terms</h2>
  <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms of Service at any time. Your continued use of our services constitutes acceptance of any changes.</p>

  <p>If you have questions about these terms, please contact us at support@movingco.ai.</p>
